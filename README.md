# Exercise 3 - ASTCompiler

* Presenter: Omri Shapira

Note: There's a Makefile to run all the commands.
I wrote it on macOS so my command for flex and bison are `flex` and `bison`

## Prerequisites
* [bison] version 3.5
* [flex] version 2.6.4
* IDE for your convenience [Visual Studio Code] or [NotePad++]
* C complier like [gcc] [clang]
 
## Running macOS

* run `make` command
* run `myprog examples/your_example.txt`

## Running Windows

Change `bison` and `flex` commands to how your command line recognizes them 

* run `make` command
* run `myprog.exe examples/your_example.txt`
